    chocolate chips ensures every bite is loaded with melty chocolate
    goodness. Optional walnuts add a delightful crunch that complements
    the rich sweetness. These cookies are incredibly versatile - you can
    customize them with different mix-ins or enjoy them as the classic
    version. The recipe yields a large batch, making it perfect for
    sharing, freezing, or satisfying a crowd. Home bakers consistently
    praise these cookies for their bakery-quality results and foolproof
    method that delivers consistently delicious treats every single time.
